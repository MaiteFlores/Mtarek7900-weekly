## What do I want to get out of this?

Open source seemed to be one of the more interactive classes to me, so that immediately caught my attention. I use a decent amount of open source software and have always wondered how people were able get ahold of it. Ive looked up open source in the past, however I was too young to understand how people collaborated together to create software. I hope to help and contribute in making something functional that other people can use, just like how I was able to use in the past. Creating hard and soft skills is very valuable and I am looking forward to learn many new things!
