# Project Log

  I have been working with LibreOffice and it was suprisingly tough to set up. Just trying to find the right files to build LibreOffice was difficult because I was missing many dependencies. When trying to make the build, it took over an hour and this had me concerned. I wasn't sure if I was doing the right thing but I decided to wait it out incase I was going the right direction. LibreOffice doesn't have an active issues handling page so I had to read many documentation from LibreOffice to ensure I was not wating time.


# Contributions

  There is a street that does not have any locations filled in OpenStreetMaps. The street is under the trainstation so I assume people had trouble pinpointing where the stores are actually located. Here are my contributions for this week.
