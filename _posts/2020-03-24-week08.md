# The Events of This Week

This week was very stressful because this month days have just tossing me around all over the place. My grandfather passed away few weeks ago and ever since then my family has been struggling. Covid-19 transitioning to that event just made things for my family much harder. It is now affecting us not only mentally, but finacially as well. I am no longer working and my dad income is low, so right now we are glued to the news in hopes that the government will give out some form of package. I doubt all these events will clear up anytime soon, but hopefully things stablize just a bit. Have been very behind on everything, but having been trying to keep myself in shape and get back to pace.

An example of a certain issue that caught my attention was this[https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/28060]
